"brown : EBM does not assume any underlying distribution of the data, but instead uses an empirical cumulative distribution function (ecdf) on the (transformed) data in X to estimate the covariance. Performs well when combining P-values on noisy data with internal correlation structure.	",
"fisher : combines  P-values assuming statistical independence between the k P-values	",
"kost: employs a polynomial approximation to calculate the covariance among the k variables based on the data in X. The covariance estimate is a measurement of statistical dependence between the k P-values and used to re-scale the Ð_2 distribution from which the combined P-value is calculated. Kost_ã_s approximation assumes normally distributed underlying data.	",
