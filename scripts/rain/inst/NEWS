Non parametric detection of oscillating behavior. 
The usage of an extended umbrella-algorithm allows to detect rhythmicity in 
limited (10-100 time points) time series of genome wide scale. Due to 
flexible assumptions the algorithm detect symmetric (sinusoidal) and asymmetric 
(saw tooth) wave forms equally well.
