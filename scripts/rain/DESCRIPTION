Description: This package uses non-parametric methods to detect rhythms
        in time series. It deals with outliers, missing values and is
        optimized for time series comprising 10-100 measurements. As it
        does not assume expect any distinct waveform it is optimal or
        detecting oscillating behavior (e.g. circadian or cell cycle)
        in e.g. genome- or proteome-wide biological measurements such
        as: micro arrays, proteome mass spectrometry, or metabolome
        measurements.
