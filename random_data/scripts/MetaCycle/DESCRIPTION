Description: This package provides two functions-meta2d and meta3d for
    detecting rhythmic signals from time-series datasets. For analyzing
    time-series datasets without individual information, 'meta2d' is 
    suggested, which could incorporates multiple methods from ARSER, 
    JTK_CYCLE and Lomb-Scargle in the detection of interested rhythms. For 
    analyzing time-series datasets with individual information, 'meta3d' is 
    suggested, which takes use of any one of these three methods to analyze 
	time-series data individual by individual and gives out integrated values 
    based on analysis result of each individual.
